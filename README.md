# LocalizableChecker
A Swift CLI to check if keys from a Localizable.strings file are unused in your project.

When you're building a translated app, you create a lot of translation keys and values. Sometimes you remove some code but you forget to remove matched translation keys. Your translation file is getting longer and you lose time to translate keys that are not yet used in your app.

This tool is for you! It will print every key from a `Localizable.strings` file that are not used in your app.

And, it will also log if a key has an empty value, such as `"mv.help.text" = "";`.

## Usage 

### Installation

Git clone project and open it.

### Settings

Before running this tool, you have to modify 2 variables:

- `sourceFilePath`: It's the path to your `Localizable.strings` in which it will check keys. Include the file name and its extension.
- `projectPath`: It's the path of your project in which each key will be checked. (The file set in `sourceFilePath` could be in this directory.)

And you can change tool's behavior by settings next variables: 

- `allowedFilesExtensions`: You can choose to only search in files with specific extensions. For example, if you want to check only in Swift files, you can set to `["swift"]` (do not add the dot).  
Setting specific extensions will make faster search.
- `expectedMinimalNbTimes`: It's the number of time you expect each key to be in files at least. For example, if you have two Localizable.strings files (for two languages), set this value to 2, because you're sure each key will appear at least 2 times in browsed files. If it appears only 2 times (or less), that means it is unused in your project.  
If you have allowed only `.swift` files (in `allowedFilesExtensions` variable), you can set this value to 0 (because `.strings` files will be skipped).
- `logEmptyValues`: Set to `true` to log when an empty value if found for a key.

### Run

Then run the tool, tap any key to start... and wait.  
As it will open each file for each key, it may take long.

If you are impatient and feel anxious of seeing nothing printed, you can set `anxiousMode` to `true`. It will print everytime a key is found in your project.

### Output

Typical output log: 

```
